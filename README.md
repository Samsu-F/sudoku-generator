# sudoku-generator

generates sudokus and their solution.
Puzzles are printed to stdout, solutions are printed to stderr.

## Formatting:
Redirect stdout to textfile, open this fiel using LibreOffice Writer.

Use page format A4, 10mm margins for top and bottom, 20mm margins (default) for left and right.

As font, use Fira Code 14.5 pt.

Now there should be two sudokus per page, ready for printing.

Be careful if you want to print to pdf with 2 pages per sheet, (at least on my machine) LibreOffice Writer
assumes you are printing on US Letter format and it refuses to print 2 pages on one A4 sheet.
